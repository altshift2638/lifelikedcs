Tanuki Lifelike Defense Script for DCS
This is a lightweight Lua script for DCS World that makes AI aircraft behave in a more realistic and human-like way during combat. Developed by Tanuki Infosec in collaboration with Nemesis Simulations, the goal is to improve immersion without making AI invincible or overly passive.

Features
Realistic, human-like defensive behavior for AI aircraft

Enables evasion of heatseeking and radar-guided missiles

AI returns fire only when attacked (Return Fire ROE)

Smooth, non-aggressive maneuvering

Automatically applies settings to all relevant AI groups shortly after mission start
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How It Works
The script:

Scans all RED and BLUE coalition aircraft groups

Filters groups by a specific name prefix (default: AI_PLANE_)

Applies the following settings:

Passive reaction to threats

Evasion for gunfire, heatseekers, and radar-guided missiles

Return Fire only (no preemptive engagement)

Non-aggressive maneuvering behavior

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration
Add Tanuki AI Lifelike Defense v0.07 for DCS World

- Implement realistic AI aircraft behavior enhancements
- Introduce human-like imperfections in combat maneuvers:
  - 30% chance for temporary cautious maneuvers during combat
  - Randomized evasion settings for different threat types
- Apply globally to all AI aircraft in both coalitions (BLUE/RED)
- Add delayed initialization system for compatibility
- Include status notifications via DCS messaging system

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features:

Core Behavior Settings:

Aggressive reaction to threats

Evasion for gunfire/heat seekers/radar missiles

Weapons Free ROE

Aggressive maneuvering baseline

Human Imperfection System:

Randomly downgrades to cautious maneuvers (30% chance)

Temporary 3-7 second cautious states

Randomized 5-10 second check intervals

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deployment:

Auto-applies to all aircraft groups in both coalitions

Staggered initialization (0-3 second delays)

Coalition-ready retry system (5-second intervals)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnostics:

Script load confirmation message

Detailed logging via env.info()

Error handling for missing groups/controllers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Notes:

Uses DCS timer API for delayed execution

Compatible with DCS scripting environment

Handles group/controller existence checks

Removed math.randomseed for DCS compatibility
